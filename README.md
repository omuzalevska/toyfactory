## Description
The Toy Factory System is a console-based application designed to manage the creation, deletion, and classification of toys in a toy factory. It allows different roles such as "Elf" and "Santa" to interact with the toy inventory, where the Elf can add, view, and remove toys, while Santa can view categorized lists of toys (Good or Bad) and save the toy list to a CSV file.

The project follows the Model-View-Controller (MVC) architecture, with:

Model: Contains the business logic (Toy and its subclasses).
View: Manages the user interface and displays output.
Controller: Acts as the intermediary between the Model and View.
